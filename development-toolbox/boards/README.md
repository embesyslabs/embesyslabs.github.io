## Logic Analyzer
🚀 Additionally, during testing and debugging, I use a logic analyzer to measure and capture the signals of microcontroller input/output pins. Logic analyzers are low cost and easy to use, making them ideal for quickly visualizing digital signals, troubleshooting communication protocols, and verifying timing in embedded projects.
