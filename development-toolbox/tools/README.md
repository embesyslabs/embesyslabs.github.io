# Development Tools

🎯 Development tools are vital for creating, testing, and debugging embedded software. In this section, I discuss commonly used tools such as IDEs, compilers, and debuggers, along with those featured in the demo projects. These resources will help you set up an efficient workflow and tackle real-world embedded development challenges.
